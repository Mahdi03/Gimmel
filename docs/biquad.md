<!--TODO-->

One of the most popular digital filters is the **biquad**, a second-order IIR filter that is highly versatile via the parameterization of its filter coefficients. While the `processSample` function of **Gimmel**'s `Biquad` class is extremely concise, the calculation of its filter coefficients from user-friendly input parameters constitutes a robust body of work.
