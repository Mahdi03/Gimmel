# *GIMMEL*: A Lightweight, Cross-Platform C++ Audio Effects Library with Pedagogical Application
Designed to compliment [Gamma](https://github.com/LancePutnam/Gamma), a synthesis oriented library, **Gimmel** seeks to provide a suite of signal processing tools familiar to instrumentalists and sound engineers, collectively known as **digital audio effects**.

While robust implementations of these effects are readily available elsewhere on GitHub, **Gimmel** seeks to differentiate itself by emphasizing [human-readability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_programming#Readability_of_source_code) and [documentation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_documentation), optimizing the codebase for use in education. See `Gimmel.md` for an introduction to digital audio generally and guides for the specific effects implemented in **Gimmel**.

If interested in a quick-start to playing with the effects, see [Gimmel-Allolib-Tests](https://github.com/allolib-s24/Gimmel-Allolib-Tests), a repository containing demo applications for **Gimmel** made with the [Allolib](https://github.com/AlloSphere-Research-Group/allolib/tree/81d8dfdf7b301ec7eff730bd6e7b0a87253a8375) framework.
