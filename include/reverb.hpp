             *
             * Requirements:
             * - minDelay:maxDelay = 1:1.5 ratio
             * - delays share no easy common factors so that we can fill the gap in between
             *
             * User is providing us with maxDelay directly, and we can directly calculate the minDelay
             * since we have the 1.5 ratio restriction
             *
             * For all the other comb filters in between, we need to somehow bridge the gap
             * parametrically(w/ respect to `t`)/smoothly to avoid accidental overlap in the
             * impulse response (we want to fill in all the gaps in between and we want the
             * comb filters all linearly independent from one another)
             *
             * Since minDelay = maxDelay/1.5 = 2/3 maxDelay, our range is from 0.666maxDelay to 1maxDelay.
             * This gives us a range of 1/3 to pick from. We can't use a linear interpolation because we
             * want an easy way to split the space evenly and get out semi-uneven values (that are hopefully
             * linearly independent).
             *
             * I originally looked to 1/3sin() from [0, pi/4] ([0,1/3] in the range), but the distribution
             * of values seemed heavily skewed to >0.5. Switching to tangential interpolation seemed smarter
             * since the distribution seemed more even. Since we already have max and min delay indices,
             * we only need everything in between. With `numCombFilters - 2` delay indices left to find, we need
             * to divide the [0, pi/4] range of tangent into `numCombFilters - 2 + 1` spaces and use those. Those
             * multipliers seem linearly independent enough and smooth enough.
             *
             * The tangent will only give us the portion of the 1/3rd we are at so we need to add on the
             * additional 2/3 we start from -> (1/3tan(n (pi/4) /numFilters) + 2/3) * maxDelay
             *
             * Simplify to (tan + 2)/3 * maxDelay (less operations, same result)
